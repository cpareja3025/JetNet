1) In the JetNet class you do class JetNet(JetDataset), why do you do the (Dataset), this is my first time seeing a class created this way.
2) In the methods parameters for getData in Jetnet you do "cls: JetDataset,". I see you're setting this cls parameter and it has to be passed in of type JetDataset. Does this mean that you're letting a user pass in a instance of JetDataset class? Because in the getData method you do cls.jet_types when calling the checkCOnvertElements method.
3) Another question I have is why do you return a set{} when calling the checkConvertElement method. For example, I called this method with "q" and it returned a set, shouldn't we have it return a single element list? In your documentation for checkStrToList you say "Converts str inputs to a list or set". I was just wondering why a set and not just a list with one element?
